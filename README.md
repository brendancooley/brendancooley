### Hi 👋

- ⚾@🧢
- In my spare time I like thinking about:
    - cities 🏙️ and how we can make them better
    - how science 📊 can be more open and cumulative (do more of it on here! :octocat:)
    - market design and mechanisms for collective decision-making 🗳️ and decentralized information aggregation
